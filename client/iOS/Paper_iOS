The iOS client contains separate files for Log Regression, Hinge Loss, Softmax and Neural Network. A View Controller, 
the foundation of an iOS application’s internal structure, calls specific algorithm according to the parameters on the
server. To use the iOS client, a user has to run the server before starting to train. A login window pops up after 
starting the iOS client. The user may use their email address and password to log in. The client creates a new account 
automatically for the first time user. After logging in, the user may enter a number in the text field and click “Start 
Training” button. The number entered indicates the number of trainings the application will perform. If the application 
is in “standalone” mode, it trains locally without communicating with server, and prints the accuracy in the console 
after each update. When not in the “standalone” mode, the application waits for server’s response after sending data to 
Firebase. Once the server completes its job, iOS client calculates and sends next data. A “Get Accuracy” button is there
to help user check the current accuracy manually. The user may use this function if his or she does not like the 
application or server to calculate accuracy at the end of each update. Additionally, iOS client resets user information
if parameters on the server are changed.
