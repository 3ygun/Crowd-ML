#### Example datasets
The MNIST datasets (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) were re-formatted into text files, 
for 10-class and binary (0 vs 1) classification problems. 
Move the training and testing files to appropriate locations when you build and run the clients and the server.

File dimensions:

* MNISTTrainImages - 10,000 samples of 784-dimension data
* MNISTTrainLabels - 10,000 samples of 10-class labels from 0-9
* MNISTTestImages - 1,000 samples of 784-dimension data
* MNISTTestLabels - 1,000 samples of 10-class labels from 0-9
* binaryTrainImages - 12,445 samples of 785-dimension data
* binaryTrainLabels - 12,445 samples of 2-class labels from 0-1
* binaryTestImages - 220 samples of 785-dimension data
* binaryTestLabels - 220 samples of 2-class labels from 0-1
